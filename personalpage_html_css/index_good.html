          <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
          <div class=p id="p1">
            My name is Neil Borle and I'm a 4th year computing science 
            student in the specialization of bioinfomatics. I started
            writing software in my first year of study at the University of
            Alberta and got hooked after that. I still really enjoy studying
            biology, so I've found a way to combine these two passions. Before
            starting university I also developed a love of music and of soccer.

          <h2>Professional History</h2>
          <div class=p id="p2">
            My first software job was working in the Department of Mathematics
            at the University of Alberta during the summer of 2011. Since
            then, I've held two summer NSERC USRAs with the Department of
            Computing Science where I worked on python development in a
            webrowser and 
            <a class=embed href=https://github.com/NBor/SkyPython>
              SkyPython
            </a> 
            respectively. Most recently (2014), through the Department of 
            Computing Science, I've held a one year work internship with 
            <a class=embed href=http://canada.emc.com/index.htm>
              EMC Corporation
            </a> 
            to develop my professional software skills. During that time I 
            maintained an existing test framework and started development 
            of a new framework.
          </div>
          <br/>
          <h2>Qualities</h2>
          <div class=p id="p3">
            From my internship and past work experiences, I've developed a
            deep knowledge of Python and a strong understanding of software
            practices. I consistently made sure that I was present for core
            work hours at EMC and have had the privilege of working with many
            different and talented people. I think my strongest asset is that
            I understand what it takes to deliver a project with the
            constraints of a professional environment.
